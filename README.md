# Maze Solver
This project gives the user the ability to design their own maze by creating a text file in the maze folder. Also providing a visulation of how these mazes are solved using both breadth first search and depth first search algorithms depending on which the user selects.

# Usage
- Clone the repository to your own directory
- To design and add new mazes to the program create a text file in the mazes directory and follow the format of the other provided mazes
- Run ./sm.exe in your terminal to run the program and select the maze, speed, and solution type (DFS or BFS)

# Skills
- Understanding of depth first search and breadth first search algorithms
- Working with abstract data types such as Queues and Stacks
- Multifile programming in C
